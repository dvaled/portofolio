- **Macros**: Reusable SQL code blocks to standardize calculations and transformations.

**Technology use**: Python, SQL, DBT, Snowflake, Apache Airflow, Docker, Astronomer cosmos


### [Regression of Used Car Prices]
Overview:
- Engineered a regression model for used car price prediction using gradient boosting algorithms
(CATBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM) and linear regression to compare performance and accuracy.
- Extracted and transformed data from multiple sources, preparing it for machine learning
applications.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify outliers and determine optimal data
adjustments, enhancing model performance.
- Designed and implemented data preprocessing pipelines to streamline transformation for
predictive modeling.
- Developed, trained, and tested the regression model, refining it through multiple algorithms to
ensure robustness and accuracy across test cases

**Technology use**: Python, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit learn, lightgbm, catboost, xgboost.


### [Foodricion](https://github.com/UhuyDev/Foodricion-ML)
**Image Classification:**
- Extracted and transformed food image data from various datasets and web sources using
Selenium and BeautifulSoup, building a robust dataset.
- Designed and implemented preprocessing pipelines with Keras ImageDataGenerator, optimizing
data for training.
- Developed and trained a MobileNetV2 model for food classification, achieving good results in
precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix evaluations.

**Technology used**:

**Chatbot:**
- Engineered a chatbot for food-related inquiries, introducing BERT embeddings (BERT-baseIndonesian) to enhance contextual understanding and relevance.
- Developed an NLP pipeline incorporating lemmatization, tokenization, and cosine similarity for
precise matching and response accuracy.
- Implemented an LSTM model, utilizing BERT-based embeddings, tokenization, and similarity
scoring for accurate, contextually aware responses.
- Tested and refined the chatbot model to achieve high accuracy and improve user experience
across varied queries.
